                           a python web framework
                              simple & powerful

                              ~~> introduce:
            muxi is a ~simple python web framework~ written by ~python~,
            based on: 
            ~werkzeug~: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug
            ~jinja2~: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2
            ~mana~: https://github.com/neo1218/mana
                      ~some certain flask extensions~

 
                              ~~> principle:
                             ~on top of flask~
            we all like ~flask~, because of ~werkzeug & jinja2~, but 
            we must admit, when we use flask to deal with some ~big project~, 
            it looks very complicated: 
                  we need to create the project directory manually,
                  import and init some certain extensions(
                      flask-wtf, flask-sqlalchemy,
                      flask-admin,  ......
                      ),
                  create and register a blueprint by hand,
                  and use flask-admin to create admin site,
                                   ......
                                  I think
                       ~it is not a good experience~


                              ~~>  muxi:
                            ~  the specific ~
      muxi has it own ~command system~(see: muxi --help) which based on ~mana~
      to generate your muxi project. you can use ~muxi command~ to:
              init(which suport a flexible options), register, 
                    deploy and manage your project.
                  
      muxi use ~sqlalchemy~ as database orm and integrated flask-sqlalchemy to
      provide a high level api, so, you can just ~from muxi import db~ 
                              and coding
            
      muxi use ~jinja2~ as front-end template, and use a very flexible way 
      to add jinja templates: the view decorator, which can import from muxi

      well, when you use muxi command to create muxi project, it will 
                    automatically generate ~admin site~

                            MIT license is great
                            
                            
                              ~~> About::Name
      the original meaning of 木犀(muxi) is {{ a sweet-scented osmanthus }} and
                    used as my :team name ~ MuxiStudio:
      beacause I love my team, so I chose muxi as this web framework's name
