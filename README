                           a python web framework
                              simple & powerful

                              ~~> introduce:
            muxi is a ~simple python web framework~ written by ~python~,
            based on: 
            ~werkzeug~: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug
            ~jinja2~: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2
            ~mana~: https://github.com/neo1218/mana
            ~flask-wtf~: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/
            ~flask-sqlalchemy~: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy
                      so: muxi is very simple but powerful~
                        
                        
                              ~~> principle:
                             ~on top of flask~
            we all like ~flask~, because of ~werkzeug & jinja2, but 
            we must admit, when we use flask to deal with some ~big project~, 
            it looks very complicated: 
                  we need to create the project directory manually,
                  import and init some certain extensions(
                      flask-wtf,
                      flask-sqlalchemy,
                      ......
                      )
                  and use flask-admin to create admin site,
                                   ......
                       ~it is not a good experience~
